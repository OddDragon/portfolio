<h2 style="color:brown;">About</h2>
  <p>I am a student at the Girls Who Code Intensive Program 2017. In the past I have attended Olympic View Elementary, Lincoln Elementary, Hamilton Middle School, and Jane Addams Middle School. I am going into my junior year at Garfield High School this fall.</p>
  <p>I love cats, drawing, and reading. I have limited experience coding because my previous attempts to learn were foiled by a Sharpie-wielding maniac.</p>
<h2 style="color:brown;">Projects</h2>

  <p>This is an image of the character in my partner Olachi and I's most recent project, in which you play as an explorer searching for Bigfoot in the woods.</p>
