<h2 style="color:brown;">About</h2>
  <p>I am a student at the Girls WHo Code Intensive Program 2017. In the past I have attended Olympic View Elementary, Lincoln Elementary, Hamilton Middle School, and Jane Addams Middle School. I am going into my junior year at Garfield High School this fall.</p>
  <p>I love cats, drawing, and reading. I have limited experience coding because my previous attempts to learn were foiled by a Sharpie-wielding maniac.</p>
