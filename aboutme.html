In the past I have attended Olympic View Elementary, Lincoln Elementary, Hamilton Middle School, and Jane Addams Middle School. I am going into my junior year at Garfield High School this fall. I love cats, drawing, and reading. I have limited experience coding because my previous attempts to learn were foiled by a Sharpie-wielding maniac. I very recently got the materials to start creating digital art, which is very exciting for me. I hope to start applying this to my work this summer and make my original art a part of my upcoming projects.";

  <p>My most recent project was a platformer that my partner Olachi and I collaborated to create. In it, you play as an adventurer searching through a forest for Bigfoot.<br>It was a challenge to develop because of the physics we had to figure out how to program into the game.</p>
<p>I am excited to work on more games in the future.</p>
